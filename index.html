               I am a very active person and enjoy a very broad range of activities that I do to pass my time. For the sake of both mine and the readers time I will only be addressing my top 3 hobbies that I currently have. These hobbies in which I have chosen are longboarding, skiing, and mountain biking.

          <h2 class="blue-header">Longboarding</h2>

               Of all the hobbies that I will write about longboarding is the hobby in which I have done for the least amount of time. This fact however does not make longboarding any less special to me. I first started longboarding two years ago after my older brother, Mason, had bought me one for Christmas. Me being the 17 year old daredevil I was went straight outside to try it out. Though I could not stay on the board for longer than a few seconds that point marked the beginning of my love for longboarding.

            <h2 id="blueHeader">Skiing</h2>

            <p>
               Skiing is by far the hobby in which I have done for the longest. As long as I can remember my brothers had went skiing a couple times every winter and I had always longed to go myself, though Mom always told me I was much too young to start. After a few years of convincing from both me and my brothers she finally agreed to let me go myself. I am still surprised she let me ski as early as she did since at this time I was only six years old. I was horribly uncoordinated and rarely reached the bottom of a slope without falling multiple times but after many failed attempt I began to get better and better. Even to this day I still go skiiing at least once a year and have many very fond memories of being out on the slopes.

          <h2 class="blue-header">Mountain Biking</h2>

               As of this point mountain biking is the hobby in which I find to be the most expensive. I first got into this hobby when my older brother, Payton, bought me an old beat up mountain bike he found for cheap online. I am still riding the same bike to this day though the only part that hasn't been replaced and upgraded is the frame. Looking back at how we looked when we first started riding together is very comical since our riding has improved a great deal since then. In areas where we used to commonly wreck and hold on for our lives we now are just able to roll over with ease. Though it may not seem like it, mountain biking has been the most difficult hobby to pick up and has taken the most effort to become better at. One of my favorite aspects of this particular hobby is the great views to see some evenings we go out and ride the trails.
